=Prerequisites=

Download and install Protege 3.*: http://protege.stanford.edu/download/registered.html

At time of writing, 3.5 beta is the latest version.

Note that Protege 4.* does not yet support Drools.

=Set up ontology=

We will reuse the ontology from previous examples.  This appears below in RDF/XML format  Save this to a text file called 'droolsDemo.owl':

=Run rules in Protege using Drools=

Open the rules in Protege.  Click on the 'Individuals' tab, then on 'Person1'.  Notice that Person1 satisfies only sections D and E.  This is because we have asserted this in the ontology above.  Protege has not inferred that the person satisfies Section A, even though this in the rules.

Now click the SWRL tab, then the Drools button:

Click the three buttons on the bottom of the screen in succession left to right:

[[image:runDrools.jpg|link=source]]

Notice that it is now inferred that Person1 satisfies Section A:
